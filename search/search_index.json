Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are getting more and more relevance as support to human decision-making processes. While AI holds the promise of delivering valuable insights into many application scenarios, the broad adoption of AI systems will rely on the ability to trust their decisions. According to IBM, some key aspects provide information to trust (or not) a decision made by an algorithm. In particular, a decision must: be reliable and fair, be accounted for, not cause harm, not be tampered with, be understandable, and be secure. In this context, the previous aspects have been grouped into the following pillars. \u2022 Fairness. One of the essential aspects to enable trusted AI is to avoid bias across the entire lifecycle of AI applications, as well as across different bias and data types. \u2022 Robustness. AI-based systems may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attackers may poison training data by injecting samples to compromise system decisions eventually. \u2022 Explainability. In many application scenarios, decisions made by algorithms must be explainable and understandable by humans. Various stakeholders require explanations for different purposes, and explanations must be tailored to their needs. \u2022 Accountability. The quality of decisions should be evaluated in terms of accuracy, ability to satisfy users\u2019 preferences, as well as other properties related to the impact of the decision.The previous characteristics are demanded from AI systems. Yet, to achieve trust in AI, more efforts and automatic mechanisms able to calculate and communicate trust levels are required.

With visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations, attackers may cause an input to be misclassified. These attacks can be generated in both the black-box setting, where the parameters of the model are unknown to the attacker, and the white-box settings, where attacker have the all necessary information about the model. To trust AI we need to be sure that it is robust against adversarial attacks.

In other words to calculate the average sensitivity of the model\u2019s loss function with respect to changes in the inputs. Empirical Robustness Assesses the robustness of a given classifier with respect to a specific attack and test data set. It is equivalent to the average minimal perturbation that the attacker needs to introduce for a successful attack. To be able to calculate empirical robustness we need to know the type and the parameters of the attack. Loss Sensitivity Local loss sensitivity quantify the smoothness of a model by estimating its Lipschitz continuity constant. Lipschitz constant measures the largest variation of the output of the model under a small change in its input. The smaller the value, the smoother the function. CLEVER Score For a given input CLEVER estimates the minimal perturbation that is required to change the classification. The derivation is based on a Lipschitz constant. The CLEVER algorithm uses an estimate based on extreme value theory. The CLEVER score can be calculated for both untargeted and targeted attacks. A higher CLEVER score indicates better robustness. Loss Sensitivity VS CLEVER Score CLEVER Score and Loss Sensitivity both uses the same idea of estimating the smoothness by Lipschitz constant. They both are attack-independent. But they have a couple of differences. Loss sensitivity uses Local Lipschitz constant estimation meanwhile CLEVER uses Cross Lipschitz constant estimation. Even though they try to estimate similar constants, Cross Lipschitz constant calculation includes an additional difference operation. Hence a model with a high CLEVER score would have a low loss sensitivity. For Loss sensitivity; the smaller the value, the smoother the function. For CLEVER score; the greater the value, the more robust the model. As CLEVER uses a sampling based method, the scores may vary slightly for different runs while Loss Sensitivity calculation is determined. Clique Method Robustness Verification for Decision Tree Ensembles For decision-tree ensemble models like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Extra Trees robustness can be verified based on clique method. For our purposes this measure might be too specific. CROWN framework for certifying neural networks CROWN is a framework for efficiently computing a certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion given any input data point for neural networks. To calculate the lower bound one must know about the activation function used in the Neural Network.
