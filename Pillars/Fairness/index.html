<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>An increasing number of information systems take decisions based on statistical inference rules, acquired through machine learning techniques. Especially in decision-critical contexts such as predictive policing, lending decisions in credit scoring or triage and allocation of health care resources discrimination is to be avoided. In order to avoid encoding discrimination in automated decisions, multiple fairness aspects needs to be accounted for.</p>

<h2 id="legally-recognized-protected-classes">Legally recognized 'protected classes'</h2>
<p>Depending on the context the stakeholders need to decide during the model creation process which systemic difference between groups should be available to the model and which should be excluded. These sensitive features should either not be used or very carefully, since they are protected by law.</p>

    * Tool’s errors were asymmetric: African-American defendants were more likely to be incorrectly labeled as higher-risk than they actually were, while white defendants were more likely to be incorrectly labeled as lower-risk than they actually were.
    * White defendants who went on to commit future crimes were assigned risk scores corresponding to lower probability estimates in aggregate.
2. <strong>Apple Credit Card</strong>
    * Apple Card's Credit Scoring Algorithm was investigated after discriminating against women.

<p>(1) and (2) are widely used ideas inspired by anti-discrimnation legislation</p>
<h3 id="1-disparate-treatment">1. Disparate Treatment</h3>
<p>A practice that intentionally disadvantages/discriminates a group based on a protected feature (<em>e.g the pay difference between men and women at the same position, </em>). The treatment or process should not depend on a sensitive feature encoding group membership.</p>
<p><strong>How to check for Disparate Treatment</strong><br />
Depending on the context certain attributes are considered to be protected. For hiring decisions in Germany for example the exmployer is not allowed to use certain information e.g (pregnancy status, wish for a child, relationship status). The user of our tool could be presented with all attributes the model is taking into consideration. He could then select every attribute he would consider in this context. On the other hand side it would be possible to define a default list of protected attributes (gender, religion, race) and let their use negatively influence the fairness score.</p>
<h3 id="2-disparate-impact">2. Disparate Impact</h3>
<p>Is what occurs when an organization’s actions, policies, or some other aspect of their processes inadvertently result in unintentional discrimination against people who are in a protected class. Even though the policy, action, or item in question would otherwise appear to be neutral. What matters is the outcome, not the intent.</p>
<p><strong>How to check for Disparate Impact</strong>  </p>
<h3 id="3-statistical-parity">3. Statistical Parity</h3>
<p>In some cases statistical parity is a central goal (and in some it is legally mandated). Statistical parity, ensures that the overall proportion of members in a protected group receiving positive (negative) classification are identical to the proportion of the population as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="4-envy-free-fairness">4. Envy Free Fairness</h3>
<p>In an envy free assignment every individual does not want to receive the anothers' assignment. E.g cake cutting where the slices have equal size.</p>
<h3 id="4-disparate-mistreatment">4. Disparate Mistreatment</h3>
<p>Classifier might make decisions for people belonging to different social groups with different misclassification rates. When the ground truth for historical decisions is available, disproportionately beneficial outcomes for certain sensitive attribute value groups can be justified and explained by means of the ground truth. Therefore, disparate impact would not be a suitable notion of unfairness in such scenarios. Disparate Mistreatment arises when the false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR) are substantially different between groups. Avoiding Disparate Mistreatment requires to establish <strong>Group Error Parity</strong> For this the prediction error (FPR, FNR) should be similar across groups and therefore independant of protected feature
E<sub>s=0</sub>[f(x,s), y] = E<sub>s=1</sub>[f(x,s), y]</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let the user select the variables that he considers to be protected from the training dataset.</li>
<li>Some metrics need to be scored by the user. For example the proper class balance and for example the question if the problem or question the model is trying to solve or predict is very hard to be assessed automatically. Therefore the user scores that fairness on a level from [0,1] or [0,100].</li>
<li>Compute metrics based on the protected attributes for example group fairness, disparate treatment score, disparate impact score etc.</li>
<li>Based on the taxonomy an overall fairness score can then be created.</li>
