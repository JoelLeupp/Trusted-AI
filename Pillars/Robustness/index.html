<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Machine Learning models might not be robust against adversarial perturbations. With visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations, attackers may cause an input to be misclassified. These attacks can be generated in both the black-box setting, where the parameters of the model are unknown to the attacker, and the white-box settings, where attacker have the all necessary information about the model. To trust AI we need to be sure that it is robust against adversarial attacks.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-questions-and-limitations">Key Takeaways, Questions and Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Key Takeaways</em><ul>
<li>Robustness is a mathematical term and context independent.</li>
<li>Mostly measured by a specific adversarial attack's success rate on the model.</li>
<li>Stability and robustness are related to models confidence score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Limitations</em><ul>
<li>Robustness can be defined as vulnerability to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is an instance with small, intentional feature perturbations that cause a machine learning model to make a false prediction. Hence robustness is defined on models where the "False Prediction" is clearly defined and where true and false predictions are sufficiently different. For example we can talk about robustness of classifiers. However it is quite difficult to talk about robustness of regression models.  </li>
<li>Robustness only makes sense if the input to the model is sufficiently large. When the input is adversarially perturbed the difference should be unnoticiable to the human eye but still be large enough to make the input misclassified. This is only possible when the input is high dimensional so that the differences can be hidden. Thats why they usually use Convolutional Neural Networks as an example.</li>
<li>The topic is well explored on neural network classifiers. For the other models I was able to find a paper proposing an attack working for neural networks, logistic regression models and SVM's. With the help of the same paper, I learned that 2 other attacks can be modified to work for logistic regression, SVM and neural networks. </li>

<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>The main idea of the robustness metrics is to calculate the minimal perturbation that is required to get an input misclassified. In other words to calculate the average sensitivity of the model’s loss function with respect to changes in the inputs.</p>
<h3 id="empirical-robustness">Empirical Robustness</h3>
<p>Assesses the robustness of a given classifier with respect to a specific attack and test data set. It is equivalent to the average minimal perturbation that the attacker needs to introduce for a successful attack.</p>
<p>To be able to calculate empirical robustness we need to know the type and the parameters of the attack.</p>
<h3 id="model-uncertainty-confidence-score">Model Uncertainty &amp; Confidence Score</h3>
<p>The model uncertainty can be estimated by computing the variance of M independently trained models predicted probability of a data point. For the same input the all of the model's predict probabilities for classes. If they returns similar probabilities, the model architecture is said to be stable and robust. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16375.pdf">experiment</a> results show that the Model Uncertainty and Confidence Scores are inversely related where the Confidence Score is defined as average prediction probability of the group of models.</p>
<p>For one model we can define Confidence Score as the ratio of probabilities of the predicted class and the second close class. Larger ratio can imply a more robust model.</p>
<h3 id="loss-sensitivity">Loss Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Local loss sensitivity quantify the smoothness of a model by estimating its Lipschitz continuity constant. Lipschitz constant measures the largest variation of the output of the model under a small change in its input. The smaller the value, the smoother the function.</p>
<h3 id="clever-score">CLEVER Score</h3>
<p>For a given input CLEVER estimates the minimal perturbation that is required to change the classification. The derivation is based on a Lipschitz constant. The CLEVER algorithm uses an estimate based on extreme value theory.</p>
<p>The CLEVER score can be calculated for both untargeted and targeted attacks. </p>
<p>A higher CLEVER score indicates better robustness.</p>
<h4 id="loss-sensitivity-vs-clever-score">Loss Sensitivity VS CLEVER Score</h4>
<p>CLEVER Score and Loss Sensitivity both uses the same idea of estimating the smoothness by Lipschitz constant. They both are attack-independent. But they have a couple of differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loss sensitivity uses Local Lipschitz constant estimation meanwhile CLEVER uses Cross Lipschitz constant estimation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though they try to estimate similar constants, Cross Lipschitz constant calculation includes an additional difference operation. Hence a model with a high CLEVER score would have a low loss sensitivity. For Loss sensitivity; the smaller the value, the smoother the function. For CLEVER score; the greater the value, the more robust the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As CLEVER uses a sampling based method, the scores may vary slightly for different runs while Loss Sensitivity calculation is determined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clique-method-robustness-verification-for-decision-tree-ensembles">Clique Method Robustness Verification for Decision Tree Ensembles</h3>
<p>For decision-tree ensemble models like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Extra Trees robustness can be verified based on clique method.
For our purposes this measure might be too specific.</p>
<h3 id="crown-framework-for-certifying-neural-networks">CROWN framework for certifying neural networks</h3>
<p>CROWN is a framework for efficiently computing a certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion given any input data point for neural networks.</p>
<p>To calculate the lower bound one must know about the activation function used in the Neural Network. Then check where the activation function is concave or convex and choose lower/upper bound functions accordingly.</p>
<p>Not a fully designed metric, just gives an upper bound with respect to the given data point.</p>
<h2 id="attacks">Attacks</h2>
<p>As most of the papers use success rate of attacks as a robustness metric we can use state-of-the-art attacks in our algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="carlini-wagner-attack">Carlini Wagner attack</h3>
<p>It is a white-box targeted attack algorithm tailored to three distance metrics (l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>0</sub>, l<sub>infinity</sub>). It is referred as a state-of-the-art attack. It tries to optimize a minimization problem using gradient descent.</p>
<p>Quite powerful, however it is often much slower than others.</p>
<p>Even though it is developed for Neural Networks, it can be modified to be effective on Logistic Regression models and Support Vector Classifiers.</p>
<h3 id="fast-gradient-attack">Fast Gradient Attack</h3>
<p>It is a white-box attack and has targeted/untargeted versions. Straightforward and practical.
It is effective on Logistic Regression models, Support Vector Classifiers and Neural Networks.</p>
<h3 id="deepfool">DeepFool</h3>
<p>An efficient attack for deep neural networks. It is white-box and untargeted. For a given input, it finds the nearest decision boundary in l<sub>2</sub> norm. It can be modified to be effective on Logistic Regression models and Support Vector Classifiers.</p>
