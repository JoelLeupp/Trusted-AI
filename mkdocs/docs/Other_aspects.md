# Other Aspects To Consider For Trusted AI Algorithm

## Privacy
Joel said there are metrics to measure privacy.

## Ethics, Governance and Compliance
They are important to consider but no metrics.

## Accuracy on Train and Test Datasets
We have to consider the accuracy as the higher accuracy implies a better/more trustworthy model. IBM considers accuracy as one of the main aspects on its display of Factsheets with Explainability, Fairness and Robustness.

However solely showing the test accuracy is not enough. The difference between the train accuracy and the test accuracy displays the quality of the model. If the train accuracy is high but the test accuracy is relatively low we could say that the model is overfitting. Hence we need to consider the difference of accuracies. 

## Data Quality
We can try to analyze data quality. We can consider the amount of data used, the proportions and the distributions of train and test datasets.
We can check for bias (correlated with fairness).
