# Accountability and Transparency
Safety, fairness, explainability and robustness are characteristics we demand from an AI system. Yet, to achieve trust in AI, engineering these traits into a final solution will not be enough; it must be accompanied with the ability to measure and communicate the performance levels of a system on each of these dimensions. IBM Research AI is working toward this objective. By demonstrating how to effectively capture events and performance metrics of an AI system on hyperledger fabric, and introduce the concept of factsheets for AI services, which outlines how these metrics can be communicated to end-users as a way of informing their understanding of how the service works, evaluating its functionality, and comprehending its strengths and limitations.

Many decision making processes can be suported by machine learning models. For example if someone should go to jail or should be released until their trial. Or if an employee will perform well and therefore should be hired or not? The involvment of the machine can reduce the humane workload, ncrease accuracy and enlarge fairness.

A FactSheet, as proposed by (Arnold et al. 2019), is a col-
lection of relevant information about an AI model or ser-
vice that is created during the machine learning life cycle.

It includes information from the business owner (e.g., in-
tended use and business justification), from the data gather-
ing/feature selection/data cleaning phase (e.g., data sets, fea-
tures used or created, cleaning operations), from the model

training phase (e.g., bias, robustness, and explainability in-
formation), and from the model validation and deployment

phase (e.g., key performance indicators). A FactSheet is as-
sociated with a model (or service) and is meant to be write

once, i.e., an update to a model would trigger a new Fact-
Sheet for the updated model. FactSheets can be consumed

by any role in the ML life cycle to confirm process gov-
ernance adherence or model performance, or by the ulti-
mate users of a model to provide increased transparency.
