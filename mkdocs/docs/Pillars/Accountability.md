Increasing trust in AI services through suppliers declarations

A FactSheet, as proposed by (Arnold et al. 2019), is a col-
lection of relevant information about an AI model or ser-
vice that is created during the machine learning life cycle.

It includes information from the business owner (e.g., in-
tended use and business justification), from the data gather-
ing/feature selection/data cleaning phase (e.g., data sets, fea-
tures used or created, cleaning operations), from the model

training phase (e.g., bias, robustness, and explainability in-
formation), and from the model validation and deployment

phase (e.g., key performance indicators). A FactSheet is as-
sociated with a model (or service) and is meant to be write

once, i.e., an update to a model would trigger a new Fact-
Sheet for the updated model. FactSheets can be consumed

by any role in the ML life cycle to confirm process gov-
ernance adherence or model performance, or by the ulti-
mate users of a model to provide increased transparency.
